    <p class="description">Squish Lamp is an exploration of softness and tactility—touch as a central but neglected site of sensory experience. In the case of the everyday objects which populate our homes, the fact (and, by extension, act) of touching something is a movement towards sensory experience, but often not considered in its own right.

    At a time when our contact with the physical world is so limited, our repetitive interactions with objects are at the forefront of our experience, and as such touch emerges as an important way of thinking about both connection and spatiality. <br> <br></p>

    <p>The lamp is made of layers of felt, subtractively laser cut to contain the electronics and the LED itself. The lamp’s upper block houses a push-button that can be clicked on and off when the user squeezes the felt. The lamp’s form is block-like and inorganic, in contrast with the sorts of objects associated with softness and manipulation. The lack of visual directives for turning the lamp on and off invites interaction and creates a sense of discoverability.</p>
